name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a></p>
<p>On Saturday, February 25th, the mortal remains of the Rev.
Francis Storr, for thirty-four years Vicar of the parish, were
buried in the beautiful churchyard of Brenchley.&nbsp; The snow
lay thick upon the ground, but the sun shone bright in heaven,
and the outward scene symbolised and reflected the feelings of
the mourners&mdash;the blank sorrow of a bereaved parish, and the
rejoicing that the last prayer of their beloved pastor had been
granted, and that he had been summoned home before increasing
years had necessitated that resignation of his work and ministry
which would have been to him a living death.</p>
<p>His work was well described by Canon Hoare, who preached the
funeral sermon:&mdash;&ldquo;He was a true specimen of a devoted
parish clergyman.&nbsp; He <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>did not take much part in things
outside his parish.&nbsp; Most thankful should we have often been
if we had had more of his help and counsel in matters concerning
the diocese and the Church.&nbsp; But the parish was his sphere,
the parish was his home, and the parish was the one object for
the benefit of which he spent his life.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bishop
of Dover writes,&mdash;&ldquo;No one could possibly be
half-an-hour in his company without seeing a transparently
Christian character, the chief features of which were personal
humility and genial sociability.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Archbishop
of Canterbury writes,&mdash;&ldquo;My last day in Brenchley, and
my walk and talk with him were one of the never-to-be-forgotten
days.&nbsp; The labour and the love which turned an affliction so
great [his blindness] into a gain, were indeed in the very spirit
of St. Paul and of his Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Born in 1808, and educated at Harrow and Queen&rsquo;s
College, Oxford, he entered the ministry in 1833 as curate of
Up-Waltham, in Sussex, where he often exchanged pulpits with
Archdeacon (now Cardinal) Manning.&nbsp; In 1837, he was
appointed to the rectory of Otley in Suffolk, through the
instrumentality of the present Bishop of Norwich, who, with a
conscientiousness which was in those days rarer than now, refused
himself to hold two livings.&nbsp; The parish had never before
had a resident incumbent.&nbsp; A dilapidated and empty church
was speedily restored and filled.&nbsp; The young preacher with
his striking presence, clear voice, and impassioned delivery,
attracted a congregation not <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>only from his own parish, but from the
neighbouring villages, where in those days such preaching was
unknown, so that hearers from twenty-three different parishes
have been counted at one Otley service.</p>
<p>In 1846, he was presented by Lord Tollemache, who as a near
neighbour had seen and appreciated his work at Otley, to the
living of Acton, in Cheshire.&nbsp; Acton is a large and
straggling agricultural parish, but with the help of curates and
district visitors, he soon got to know each household almost as
intimately as in the village of Otley, and any one in trouble,
whether of mind or body, instinctively turned to the
Vicarage.&nbsp; Acton was one of the first parishes, if not the
first parish, to give up generally the practice of Sunday
cheese-making.&nbsp; Till, at his instigation, the experiment was
tried, it had been pronounced by farmers an impossibility.&nbsp;
After eight years of incessant labour (he was hardly absent as
many Sundays from his parish), the declining health of his wife
compelled him to move southward, and he was appointed to the
living of Brenchley, vacant by the death of the Rev. R. Davies,
Secretary of the C.M.S., whose widow some years later became his
second wife.&nbsp; The special work of his predecessor was
carried on by him with ever-increasing zeal and success, and,
whereas in 1848 Brenchley had scarcely heard of the C.M.S., in
1887 the contribution from the parish amounted to over
&pound;300.&nbsp; Part of this sum came from outside friends who
knew that the <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>most acceptable birthday present they could make to the
Vicar was a subscription to his favourite Society, but the larger
proportion was given in sixpences and coppers.&nbsp; It must not
be supposed that this preference made him overlook other claims,
or ignore other charitable societies.&nbsp; In particular, the
London City Mission, the Flower Mission, and the Bible Society
were very near his heart.&nbsp; As for the wants of his own
parishioners, he not only gave profusely himself, but he was
indefatigable in urging their claims on all who could or would
give.&nbsp; He was, I believe, the first incumbent in Kent to
remit, without solicitation, a percentage of the tithe.&nbsp;
Latterly, in hop-gardens where no hops were picked, the tithe was
wholly remitted, and no farmer who was in real straits was ever
pressed for payment.&nbsp; For labourers out of work, work was
somehow made or found.&nbsp; Thus, during the last winter, as
many as thirty at a time were employed by him in
road-making.&nbsp; Endless similar charities might be recorded,
and still more were done in secret and unknown; but these would
wholly fail to represent &ldquo;that best portion of a good
man&rsquo;s life, his little nameless unremembered acts of
kindness and of love.&rdquo;&nbsp; His utter unselfishness and
his quick power of sympathy endeared him to an ever-widening
circle of friends.&nbsp; He never lost sight of any he had known,
and all, whether rich or poor, knew that, if content with simple
fare, they would be welcome visitors at the Vicarage.</p>
<p>During the last ten years of his life, the greatest <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>of earthly
privations was sent him.&nbsp; There was a gradual failure of
sight, ending in total blindness.&nbsp; None who knew him even
slightly can have failed to admire the serenity and cheerfulness
with which this loss was borne.&nbsp; Like Milton, he
&ldquo;bated not a jot of heart or hope, but still bore up and
steered right onward . . . content, though blind.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
never would admit that it was to him a heavy trial, though to a
man of his independent character and restless energy it must have
been a daily thorn in the flesh.&nbsp; Thanks to the guidance of
loving hands, he was able to continue to the last his pastoral
visits, and would fearlessly mount the narrowest and steepest
stairs of cottages, wherever the sick or dying needed his
ministrations.&nbsp; His sermons and lectures seemed almost to
gain in power by his concentration of thought and abstraction
from objects of sense.&nbsp; He would not rarely take (I had
almost written &ldquo;read&rdquo;) the whole of the Morning
Service, including the Psalms and the Holy Communion.&nbsp; Even
in his eightieth year his memory was hardly impaired, and he
would give chapter and verse for text after text quoted in his
sermons.&nbsp; His knowledge of the Bible was wonderful; it was
as if he had it photographed on his heart.&nbsp; The last sermon,
preached only nine days before his death, was clear, stirring,
and energetic, and bore no trace of flagging powers.</p>
<p>His life was one of the many golden threads that run through
the variegated warp of England&rsquo;s Church history, and show
the continuity of her <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>ministry.&nbsp; Though severed by five
centuries, he is the direct lineal descendant of Chaucer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;poure Persoun of a toun,&rdquo; and there is scarce a word
in that marvellous portraiture that might not have been written
of Francis Storr, for</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Christes
lore, and his apostles twelve,<br />
He taughte, but first he folwede it himselve.&rdquo;</p>

FRANCIS STORR.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>From the</i> <span
class="smcap">Record</span>, <i>March</i> 2<i>nd</i>, 1888.</p>
<p>Among the deaths of last week our readers will have seen the
name of the Rev. Francis Storr, Vicar of Brenchley, Kent.&nbsp;
The news reached us only in time to record the bare fact, but we
cannot pass over in silence a life, uneventful indeed, but none
the less noteworthy.&nbsp; Mr. Storr was one of the oldest, if
not the oldest, of a remarkable band of men, linked together by
common views and doctrines, but still more closely united by the
apostolic zeal and devotedness to Christ&rsquo;s service which
animated one and all.&nbsp; He was the brother-in-law and
intimate ally of Dean Champneys and Bishop Utterton, and the
life-long friend of the Bishop of Norwich and the Bishop of
Liverpool.</p>
<p>Born in 1808, he graduated at Oxford in 1833 (the year of the
first appearance of <i>Tracts for the Times</i>), being awarded
an honorary Fourth Class.&nbsp; With the Tractarian movement he
felt no sympathy, and, though on terms of friendship with some of
<a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the
leaders of that movement, from the very first he threw in his lot
with the Evangelical party, never swerving in his allegiance to
the end, though ripening years taught him more and more to see
good in everything and to attach less importance to party
distinctions.&nbsp; In the same year he was ordained by the
Bishop of Chichester to the curacy of Up-Waltham, and two years
after he took the curacy of Beckenham, Kent.&nbsp; Here he
married his first wife, Caroline, daughter of Colonel Holland of
Langley Farm, Beckenham, a true and constant helpmate during the
twenty years that she was spared to share his labours.&nbsp; In
1837 he was presented to the living of Otley, in Suffolk, and in
this small but neglected parish his energies found for a time
full scope.&nbsp; When he came, there was no parsonage (no
previous Rector had ever lived in the parish), the church was
dilapidated, and the churchyard a neglected waste.&nbsp; A
parsonage was built, the church restored, and the churchyard
reclaimed.&nbsp; But the spiritual change wrought by his means in
the parish was even more striking.&nbsp; The voice of one crying,
not in a dissenting chapel, but from a Church of England pulpit,
&ldquo;Repent ye,&rdquo; and appealing with all the fervour and
some of the eloquence of a Whitfield, to the individual
conscience was a strange sound in that sleepy hollow.&nbsp; Those
who had never before set foot in a church came, first from
curiosity, then from genuine interest, and then carried the good
news to their neighbours, so that the little church could
sometimes <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>not contain the hearers who came from twenty parishes
round.&nbsp; His sermons were wholly extempore; he never took a
note with him into the pulpit.&nbsp; In the most literal sense of
the words, &ldquo;he preached unto them the Scriptures,&rdquo;
for having studied the text of the Bible as few clergymen are now
wont in these days of multiplied expositions and commentaries,
and being gifted with a strong memory, he would pour forth verse
after verse in support of any point he was urging, giving in each
case the exact reference.&nbsp; But it was even more by
house-to-house visitation than in the pulpit that he made his
influence felt.&nbsp; By his absolute unselfishness, his
large-hearted sympathy, his deep personal humility, and his
genial humour, he found his way sooner or later to every heart,
and Dissenters who would denounce him in public as part and
parcel of the hated and apostate Establishment, welcomed him in
private as their truest counsellor and friend.&nbsp; Over
children he exercised almost a fascination; they would follow him
along the village street like the Pied Piper, and for each child
he would have his sportive nickname or little private joke.</p>
<p>Leaving Otley for Acton was one of the greatest trials to his
singularly affectionate nature, and to the end of his life Otley
and its people were very dear to his heart.&nbsp; But, much as he
loved his first parish, he felt that he could not resist the call
to a wider sphere of duty.&nbsp; Of his work at Acton, his
successful crusade against Sunday cheese-making, and his
unflagging work and labour, both spiritual <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and sanitary,
in the fatal cholera year, we have left ourselves no space to
speak.&nbsp; We must pass to the last and longest chapter of his
life at Brenchley, of which for thirty-four years he was the
Vicar.&nbsp; Succeeding the Rev. Richard Davies, the faithful and
devoted Secretary of the C.M.S., he accepted as a sacred legacy
the furtherance of the claims of that Society.&nbsp; How
successfully he pleaded its cause is shown by the fact that in
1886 Brenchley, a rural parish with no resident squire, sent up a
larger contribution than the whole of Scotland.&nbsp; The chief
proportion of this came from the coppers of missionary boxes, and
the proceeds of a missionary basket to which an old servant of
the family was &ldquo;told off.&rdquo;&nbsp; During his
incumbency the growing district of Paddock Wood, and the
off-lying hamlet of Matfield, were made into separate
parishes.&nbsp; If all parishes had had an Incumbent like the
Vicar of Brenchley, we may confidently say that the question of
extraordinary tithe would never have arisen.&nbsp; Each defaulter
was treated by him as a tenant in arrears with his rent would be
treated by an indulgent landlord, and in bad years some remission
of tithe was freely granted at a time when such indulgence was
unknown, at least in Kent.&nbsp; Nor were the labourers less
cared for than the farmers.&nbsp; No man or woman who could show
a plausible case of distress was ever sent empty away from the
Vicarage, and relief was always, if possible, given in kind or by
providing employment.&nbsp; For the hop-pickers who swarmed each
autumn from <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>the slums of London one or more Scripture-readers from
the London City Mission were always retained; field meetings,
magic-lantern entertainments, &amp;c., were got up; pressure was
brought to bear on the farmers to supply more decent sleeping
accommodation&mdash;in a word, they were treated for the time as
members of the flock, and, as far as time and opportunity
permitted, Christianised.&nbsp; Of his private life this is not
the place to speak, but this much we may venture to
state&mdash;no man since Dr. Primrose numbered so many poor
relations, for the plea of poverty or distress was at once
admitted by him as a claim of kinship.&nbsp; And he never lost
sight of a friend.&nbsp; Curates who had worked with him forty
years ago would still write to seek his counsel and help in any
difficulty.</p>
<p>For the last ten years of his life it pleased God to afflict
him with the hardest of human trials&mdash;the total loss of
sight.&nbsp; Yet he found a way to turn his loss to gain, and his
noble example of cheerful and almost joyous resignation to the
will of his Father more than compensated for any diminution of
his energy as a pastor.&nbsp; Not indeed that he relaxed or
slackened his work to the very end.&nbsp; In his eightieth year
it was his habit to take the Communion Service and Sermon in the
Morning, and to read Prayers in the Afternoon; and, though he had
necessarily to depend more on others for seeking information and
carrying out his behests, no household in the parish was unknown
or uncared for.</p>
<p>His last prayer, &#7952;&nu; &phi;&#8049;&epsilon;&iota;
&kappa;&alpha;&#8054;
&#8004;&lambda;&epsilon;&sigma;&sigma;&omicron;&nu;, was granted
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>him, and
he died in harness, quietly, almost painlessly, and with
consciousness to the last.&nbsp; One minute only before he was
taken, he asked one of his sons on what text he had preached the
previous Sunday, and on being told, &ldquo;Our Father, which art
in heaven,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;Our Father&mdash;in those
two words, rightly understood, lies the whole of the
Gospel.&rdquo;</p>

SERMON<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Rev. Canon Hoare</span>, M.A.<br />
<i>Sunday Morning</i>, <i>February</i> 26<i>th</i>, 1888.</h2>
<blockquote><p>Ezekiel xxxiii. 33: &ldquo;<i>And when this cometh
to pass</i> (<i>lo</i>, <i>it will come</i>), <i>then shall they
know that a prophet hath been among them</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">You</span> can see at a glance the
application of these words to the solemn occasion that has
brought us together this day.&nbsp; They were spoken to
Ezekiel.&nbsp; He was a very popular and attractive
preacher.&nbsp; The people sat before him, and his words were
unto them &ldquo;as a very lovely song of one that hath a
pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But they produced no effect; for the people heard his words, but
they did them not.&nbsp; These words were therefore spoken to
warn them that when certain predicted troubles should arise, they
would learn the truth of Ezekiel&rsquo;s ministry.&nbsp; Those
troubles are described in verses 27, 28; and these words were
added to warn the people that when all this should come to
pass&mdash;which it most surely would do&mdash;they would then
learn the awful fact that there had been a terrible <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>reality in
the message of the prophet, and be taught by too late experience
that, although they had regarded him not, they had had a prophet
among them.</p>
<p>Now, the word &ldquo;prophet&rdquo; is not applied only to
those persons who were moved by the Spirit to predict the future,
such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel.&nbsp; It means one who
speaks forth the Word of God, and proclaims the message of God in
the Lord&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; It is a term therefore that, in this
its wider sense, may well be applied to your late beloved pastor,
our dear and honoured brother now taken from us, of whom it may
be said with the most perfect truth that for thirty-four years he
went in and out a true prophet among you.</p>
<p>He was a prophet in the true meaning of the word, for he spent
his life in publishing or speaking forth amongst you the hidden
mysteries of the salvation of God.&nbsp; We quite acknowledge
that he was not a prophet like Ezekiel, carried away in lofty
flights of inspired ecstasy; nor like John the Baptist, feeding
on locusts and wild honey; but he was one who was in his own
quiet, devoted life a true prophet, and who for fifty-five years
laboured for souls and faithfully preached Christ Jesus his
Saviour.</p>
<p>I have no words to express my profound reverence for such a
man.&nbsp; He was a true specimen of that most honourable class,
the country clergymen of the Church of England.&nbsp; He did not
take much part in things outside the parish.&nbsp; Most <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>thankful
should we often have been if we had had more of his valuable help
and counsel in matters concerning the Diocese and the
Church.&nbsp; But the parish was his sphere, the parish was his
home, and the parish was the great object for which he spent his
life.</p>
<p>Remember him, then, in his Pastoral work.&nbsp; For
thirty-four years (the best part of his ministry) you have
enjoyed this privilege.&nbsp; I am speaking, I know, to a
bereaved flock; and I want you to look back on your past
privileges.&nbsp; He went in his pastoral work into the homes of
his people.&nbsp; Think of him: how kind, how faithful, how full
of sympathy, how diligent in visiting, even in his
blindness.&nbsp; Was he not in very truth a true friend to you
all?&nbsp; I am sure every heart must answer, &ldquo;He
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Think of him among the Young.&nbsp; The majority of you must
have grown up under his care, and you know what an interest he
took in you; how he watched over you in the schools, cared for
you in your confirmation, and welcomed you when you became
communicants at the Table of the Lord.</p>
<p>In my position at Tunbridge Wells, I see young people from all
the surrounding villages, and by the candidates which I have for
confirmation I can form some estimate of what is going on in the
different parishes.&nbsp; Now I always have a good hope when I
have to do with young people who have been brought up at
Brenchley.&nbsp; I find them, as a general rule, well trained in
the Gospel.&nbsp; I cannot <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>say that they all love it, but they
have been taught it, and all that the pastor can do has been done
for them in their early training.&nbsp; How many are there in
this church at this present time who can look back with profound
thanksgiving to lessons taught them in early life by that
venerable man!</p>
<p>Think of him in his Missionary work.&nbsp; I do not mean in
parochial missions, such as you have just been having&mdash;I
mean in his warm love for that grand institution, the Church
Missionary Society.&nbsp; Were there ever known such Bible and
Missionary meetings as those in his schoolroom?&nbsp; What a holy
enthusiasm did he kindle amongst us!&nbsp; What a glow there was
all around him!&nbsp; The dullest hearts could not fail to catch
his fire.&nbsp; How he knew the history of each box!&nbsp; He
could not see the records because of his blindness, but he knew
all about the boxes and their possessors; and it was impossible
to be apathetic in his presence.&nbsp; And what was the secret of
it all?&nbsp; How was it brought about?&nbsp; How was this fire
kindled&mdash;this enthusiasm?&nbsp; Was it not that he was a man
of prayer?&nbsp; I remember the last meeting I was at in
Brenchley.&nbsp; Just before we left the Vicarage we knelt
together in his study, and there he poured out his whole soul
before God, and pleaded for that blessing which he found awaiting
him when we reached the schoolroom.&nbsp; There was the secret of
his power, and there it was that he learned that even in his loss
of eyesight God&rsquo;s grace was sufficient for his need.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Then
think of him in the Church.&nbsp; What a wonderful thing to have
seen that man, totally blind, standing at the Communion Table
only last Ash Wednesday, and going through the service with the
Epistle and Gospel as well as those who have their full
vision.&nbsp; It was a grand thing to see the blind man not
reading the prayers but repeating them.&nbsp; He had loved those
prayers throughout his ministry; he had prayed them all through
the days of his eyesight, and they had become so completely a
part of himself that, when his eyesight was gone, the prayers
remained written both on his memory and soul; so that instead of
sight he had memory, and instead of his prayer-book he made use
of the fleshy tables of the heart.&nbsp; That is the way to
pray.</p>
<p>And then follow him to the Pulpit.&nbsp; How often has he
stood in this pulpit to plead with you!&nbsp; He must have
preached in this church between three and four thousand sermons!
and who can measure the value of such a ministry?&nbsp; Here he
stood as the ambassador for Christ, &ldquo;warning every man and
teaching every man in all wisdom that he might present every man
perfect in Christ Jesus,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Here he stood to
warn the wicked, to awaken the careless, to carry hope to the
convicted, to proclaim pardon to the repentant, help to the weak,
comfort to the afflicted, and to give food to those hungering and
thirsting after righteousness.&nbsp; To sum up, he preached the
Gospel of God through the power of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>And how
earnestly did he do it, and how prayerfully! how faithfully and
yet how tenderly!&nbsp; How did his heart yearn for souls!&nbsp;
How did he first plead with God for sinners in his own home, and
then come here to plead with sinners for God!&nbsp; It is to such
preaching as this that for the last thirty-four years you have
listened habitually, and who shall venture to say that there has
not been a prophet among you?</p>
<p>Once more, look at him on his Death-bed.&nbsp; For a long time
it had been his constant prayer that it would please God to take
him home before he had to give up his work, and so when the
answer came all was ready.&nbsp; There was no alarm, no hurry, no
confusion.&nbsp; He could still think of his beloved people whom
he was about to leave, mentioning by name some of the sick and
aged whom he was habitually visiting.&nbsp; He could say, as Mr.
Standfast in &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; did, &ldquo;I
see myself now at the end of my journey; my toilsome days are
ended.&nbsp; I have formerly lived by faith, but now I go where I
shall live by sight, and shall be with Him in whose company I
delight myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so in the peaceful calm of an assured faith, with his
blessed Saviour full in view, and his beloved people, like the
names on Aaron&rsquo;s breastplate, borne still on his heart, he
could step across the border-line to receive from his Lord, whom
he had so faithfully served and so truly loved, the blessed
welcome, &ldquo;Well done, good and faithful servant, enter thou
into the joy of thy Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>And
now, what was the secret of the whole character and the whole
work?&nbsp; What was it that made him what he was in the home, in
the parish, amongst the young, in the mission work, in the
church, and on his death-bed?&nbsp; What was it that was the very
essence of his life?</p>
<p>There was one thing, and one only.&nbsp; And what was
that?&nbsp; I appeal to all who knew him.&nbsp; Am I not right in
saying that it was nothing else than the glorious old Gospel of
the Grace of God in Christ Jesus, his blessed Saviour?&nbsp; On
that he lived, on that he laboured, on that he died; and that was
the one secret of his peace and power.&nbsp; He was not ashamed
of the Gospel of Christ; he knew it as the power of God unto
salvation in his own soul, and he did not want to attempt to
improve it by any new-fangled notions of the nineteenth
century.&nbsp; He believed in what have been called the three
R&rsquo;s&mdash;Ruin, Redemption, and Regeneration.&nbsp; He was
one of what people call the old-fashioned Evangelical
school&mdash;and a very good fashion too, for what foundation so
good as one that has been tried?&nbsp; He believed in the utter
ruin of human nature; in the satisfaction of the Law through the
propitiatory sacrifice of the Son of God; in the free pardon
through the Blood of the Lamb, and justification through faith
alone; in the perfection of imputed righteousness; in the new
birth by the Holy Ghost; in His sanctifying power in the souls of
believers.&nbsp; He believed that the Lord Jesus Christ would
come again, and would keep <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>His people safe to the end; and with
a happy, peaceful, bright expectation, he could live
&ldquo;looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing
of our Great God and Saviour Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
were the great principles of his life; and by them was his whole
character governed.&nbsp; These were the truths on which he lived
himself, and which he taught in his ministry; and these were the
principles which I trust he has left indelibly written on the
hearts and understandings of all of you, who for these many years
have enjoyed the privilege of being members of his flock.</p>
<p>We are all agreed, then, that there has been a true prophet
among you; and now the question is, What has been the result of
his prophecy?&nbsp; His labour is over, he is gone to his rest,
and we may apply to him the words, &ldquo;Blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord from henceforth; Yea, saith the Spirit,
that they may rest from their labours, and their works do follow
them&rdquo; (Rev. xiv. 13).&nbsp; And now we have to consider
what works there are to follow him.&nbsp; In the case of Ezekiel
there was great disappointment.&nbsp; He was an inspired man, and
a most attractive preacher.&nbsp; He was one that was heard with
admiration; but there was no result, for the people did not act
on his words.</p>
<p>Now I fear we must believe that it has been the same with some
at Brenchley, for we have no reason to expect that the results of
our ministry will be different to that of the ministry of <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>St. Paul, of
which it is said, &ldquo;Same believed the things which were
spoken, and some believed not&rdquo; (Acts xxviii. 24).&nbsp; In
all probability, therefore, there are in this parish some who
have been familiar with the venerable man labouring amongst them,
and who have often heard his earnest words, but have never yet
been touched in heart by the grace of God.&nbsp; The hard heart
has never yet been broken, the self-will has never yet submitted,
and they are still as far from God as if there had never been a
prophet among them.&nbsp; Now, if there be such here,
remember.&nbsp; You will never hear that voice again; you will no
more listen to his earnest pleadings with you for your
souls.&nbsp; But those appeals may still tell on you.&nbsp; It is
said of Abel, &ldquo;He, being dead, yet speaketh.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now you know his character, you know how true and consistent he
was; you have heard how peacefully he could depart to be with
Christ; and may not his death reach your heart even if his life
has failed to do so?&nbsp; What do you think he would say to you
now if he could speak from heaven?&nbsp; He might speak possibly
with more persuasive earnestness, but I do not believe there
would be the slightest change in his message.&nbsp; I firmly
believe that it would be nothing but the same old, old
story&mdash;Christ Jesus for the sinner, and the sinner for
Christ Jesus.&nbsp; Think, then, of all you can remember of his
ministry.&nbsp; You will never hear it again, so gather up the
fragments that remain that nothing be lost.&nbsp; In some cases
there may be but very little, for Satan carried most of it away
before you left the <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>church; but let that little tell.&nbsp; If you remember
nothing more, remember, at all events, his earnestness for your
souls&rsquo; salvation; remember how he watched for your souls as
one that must give account; and if you pained and grieved him by
your carelessness when here, remember that you may possibly be
able to gladden him even now, for are we not told that
&ldquo;there is joy in heaven over one sinner that
repenteth,&rdquo; &amp;c.?&nbsp; So let his heart be gladdened
even in heaven; let the angels carry up the blessed tidings that
the lost sheep is found, and do you listen to those words of St.
Peter, which I am sure would be the words of the saint before the
throne: &ldquo;Repent and be converted every one of you, that
your sins may be blotted out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it is not to all that I would repeat those words, for I
cannot doubt for one moment that the ministry of my dear friend
was not in vain in the Lord.&nbsp; There cannot be the slightest
doubt that God has richly blessed that ministry to the salvation
of very many souls.&nbsp; Who can doubt that there are at this
present moment very many with himself before the Throne of God,
who owe their place there to God&rsquo;s blessing on his work in
this parish?&nbsp; What a loving welcome must they have given him
last Wednesday!&nbsp; And how many are there amongst the living;
how many in this church this morning; how many of you who are now
before me, have reason to bless God for all eternity for that
knowledge of Christ Jesus your Saviour <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>which you learned through the
instrumentality of him who will now speak to you no more?&nbsp;
May it not be said of this church, &ldquo;This and that man was
born here&rdquo;?&nbsp; Has not God the Holy Ghost brought life
to your souls in Christ Jesus, that life which is in the
knowledge of Him? and have you not reason most profoundly to
thank God for him whom He sent to be to you the messenger of
mercy?</p>
<p>And now he is gone, and what are you to do?&nbsp; The prophet
is gone, and what remains?&nbsp; That is a good verse for such an
occasion in Phil. ii. 12, for it is the voice of the absent
pastor, and it teaches that the flock when bereaved must be
thrown on their own personal union with God
himself&mdash;&ldquo;Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always
obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my
absence, work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling, for
it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good
pleasure.&rdquo;&nbsp; So now remember that the Lord Jesus Christ
is not taken from you.&nbsp; Though your beloved Vicar is gone,
your Saviour remains.&nbsp; You may draw as near to Him this day
as you did when that beloved voice led you in prayer.&nbsp; So
keep fast to Him, and in Him to each other.&nbsp; Whenever there
is a change in the ministry there is a tendency to unsettlement,
but let there be no unsettlement here.&nbsp; Do not begin to
wander because he is gone; but walk in the steps in which he
sought to lead you, as consistent Churchmen abiding in the old
paths, <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>and
as humble believers so keeping close to the Lord Jesus Christ
that, through the power of the Holy Ghost given in Him, you may
be enabled through His great grace to glorify His name.</p>

SERMON<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Rev</span>. W. May, M.A.<br />
<i>Sunday Afternoon</i>, <i>February</i> 26<i>th</i>, 1888.</h2>
<blockquote><p>2 Kings ii. 5: &ldquo;<i>Knowest thou that the
Lord will take away thy master from thy head to-day</i>? <i>and
he answered</i>, <i>Yea</i>, <i>I know it</i>, <i>hold ye your
peace</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Would</span> not an empty pulpit to-day
have been the most effective sermon?&nbsp; The voice which for
thirty-four years has spoken to you from this place, so
faithfully, so fervently, so wisely, and with the eloquence
always of love&mdash;that voice is silent.&nbsp; There was once
&ldquo;silence in heaven about the space of half-an-hour;&rdquo;
and a still silence might be a speaking testimony here, to him
who on Wednesday week was ministering in this church, and the
Wednesday after was called home&mdash;a testimony to the life
which he led, to the truths which he taught, and the precious
fragrance of loving words and deeds which he has left
behind.&nbsp; It seems as if God Himself were dealing with us,
too closely <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>almost for human intervention; dealing with our
consciences, our memories, our hearts.&nbsp; The Lord has taken
away our master from our head to-day.&nbsp; Should we not hold
our peace?&nbsp; Ought we not to be dumb and open not our mouth,
because He is acting?&nbsp; Should we not in thought and
imagination go in and stand before our Master, judging ourselves
that we be not judged of the Lord, accounting to Him for the way
we have dealt with His servant, and then, convicted every one of
us&mdash;as well we may be, the preacher first&mdash;by our own
conscience, go out one by one, saying, &ldquo;How dreadful is
this place: this is none other but the House of God, and this is
the gate of heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; For a gate of heaven truly it
is.&nbsp; It has been the gate of heaven for twenty-five years to
the speaker, and but for words spoken at this gate, God only
knows whether he would be able to-day to subscribe with his hand
unto the Lord and say, &ldquo;I am His.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sermons
reckoned by the thousand, full of sacred truth, full of
sanctified common sense, full of marked originality, full of
&ldquo;power and love and of a sound mind&rdquo;&mdash;these have
to be accounted for.</p>
<p>And his prayers, public and private&mdash;prayers put up for
us on every possible occasion&mdash;effectual fervent prayers of
a righteous man standing ever in thought and feeling in the
presence of God, and in the sweet, bracing, healthful atmosphere
of unfeigned love to man, these are responsibilities which none
can evade.</p>
<p>What a true pastor he was! what a faithful <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>friend! what
a saintly servant! what a large-hearted man!&nbsp; Which of us
but has had proof, nay, countless proofs of his
loving-kindness?&nbsp; Which of us could ever have succeeded,
even if we had wished, in making that man our enemy?&nbsp; Oh!
brethren, tears may well be in our hearts to-day&mdash;well may
we weep for ourselves and for our children, weep because he is
gone, weep because not one of us appreciated him enough, prayed
for him enough, loved him enough, while he was still here.&nbsp;
Oh! but he was a pastor who pressed his dear people to his heart,
and then bore them up on that large heart of his before his
divine Master,&mdash;every one of us, and our needs were
continually in his mind.&nbsp; And now the Master has need of
<i>him</i>, and has come and called him away; and, after a short
and comparatively easy passage, he has forded the river, and gone
up the shining path, and we stand alone and cry, &ldquo;My
father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen
thereof,&rdquo; and we see him no more.</p>
<p>And yet he would not have us silent to-day.&nbsp; He would bid
us encourage ourselves, encourage one another in the Lord.&nbsp;
He would exhort us to preach the Word.&nbsp; He would remind us
that the time is short, and beseech us to buy up the
opportunity.&nbsp; Let us do it, checking our tears.&nbsp; Did
not we hear only yesterday that word of Christ, &ldquo;Whosoever
liveth and believeth in me shall never die&rdquo;?&nbsp; Is there
then loss to-day of any man&rsquo;s <i>life</i> amongst us, or
only of the ship?&nbsp; &ldquo;Not lost, but gone before,&rdquo;
<a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>is that
life, if the word of Christ be true.&nbsp; Our pastor &ldquo;is
not dead, but sleepeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The ship is broken by the
violence of the waves, but all the <i>life</i> is &ldquo;safe to
land.&rdquo;&nbsp; The casket is shattered, but the precious
jewel is in the hand, nay, in the very bosom of the
Saviour.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is not dead, but sleepeth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>Dead</i> four days?&nbsp; Nay, but <i>alive</i>, with a life
far brighter and keener and more joyous than he ever had on
earth!&nbsp; He sleeps well, and presently the Lord of life will
say, &ldquo;I go that I may awake him out of sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And how near that day-dawn, that awaking time may be, the morning
of the resurrection, when the dead in Christ shall rise
first.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the voice that speaks to us from that
farther shore, aye, and will speak &ldquo;till thought and memory
flee&rdquo;&mdash;that voice saith in death, when it cannot be
silent, what it would have hesitated in its humility to say in
life: &ldquo;Be ye followers of me, even as I am of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so we call upon the Holy Ghost, the
Spirit of the Living God and of Jesus, and offer this
prayer&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Refining fire, go through my heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Illuminate my soul;<br />
Scatter Thy life through every part,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sanctify the whole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My steadfast soul from falling free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall then no longer move,<br />
And Christ be all in all to me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all my heart be love.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turn we now from our dear master who has been taken away to
that Master, still more dear, <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>that perfect Master, &ldquo;chiefest
among ten thousand, and altogether lovely,&rdquo; who
remains.&nbsp; <i>They</i> fail, but <i>Thou</i> remainest.&nbsp;
Human friends, comforters, pastors forsake us, but Thou, O
Christ, art with us all the days even unto the end.&nbsp; Even an
Elijah, that chief of the prophets, had to go up and stand before
his Master.&nbsp; But we, beloved, have a kingdom which cannot be
moved, and a kingly Master who cannot die.&nbsp; He, &ldquo;the
same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever, is able to keep us from
falling.&nbsp; He shall preserve us blameless, and present us
faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding
joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Earth and heaven are not very far apart.&nbsp; When we stand
at the foot of the ladder with the ascending and descending
angels, when we sit at the feet of Jesus, some down here, some up
there, but <i>all</i>, all for ever at His feet, and all, all for
ever in His hand, and every one of us receiving of His
words&mdash;when this is so, beloved, heaven draws very near to
earth, and earth to heaven; and when the gate opens to receive
some loved one in, we can almost hear the music and the
singing.&nbsp; There is just this difference and distinction:
here on earth we are labouring to enter into rest; there they are
resting in the midst of joyful labour, being so close to their
King.&nbsp; <i>We</i> might be closer than we are, and thus have
more &ldquo;days of heaven upon earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And now, feeling sure on this occasion of your <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>forbearance
and sympathy, I add a few things which may interest you
concerning our earthly master, father, teacher, friend, taken
from our head to-day by the Lord.</p>
<p>His knowledge of Scripture was wonderful, was it not? and his
memory for quotation&mdash;not the words only, but chapter and
verse&mdash;up to the very last, after ten years of total
blindness.</p>
<p>His knowledge too of that piece of intricate and, alas!
disordered mechanism, the human heart, was remarkable.&nbsp; How
his sermons turned us inside out, so to speak, but all loving,
wise, and persuasive, leading us to Christ and to comfort.</p>
<p>The wondrous mixture in his disposition and character of
thorough humanity and great spirituality&mdash;of manliness,
vigour and cheerfulness, with a very tender, sympathising
heart!&nbsp; How he could turn at once, and without causing any
jar to our feelings, or any sense of discrepancy in his action,
from the brightest play of mirth and humour to fervent, pleading
prayer.&nbsp; How <i>real</i> and transparent he was, both as a
man and a Christian!</p>
<p>There is another thing I desire to mention.&nbsp; &ldquo;When
the messengers of John were departed, Jesus began to speak unto
the people concerning John: What went ye out into the wilderness
to see, a reed shaken with the wind? . . . a man clothed in soft
raiment? . . . a prophet?&rdquo;&nbsp; You remember that
<i>that</i>, on Sunday week, was the text your dear pastor last
preached from; and what reply can we give to that question as
regards himself?&nbsp; Was he <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>a fickle, changeable man, &ldquo;a
reed shaken with the wind&rdquo;?&nbsp; Was he a man living
delicately, surrounding himself with luxury, and not rather a man
given to self-denial, rising very early in the morning, winter
and summer, and depriving himself of comforts, almost of
necessaries, for the sake of his beloved poor?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what went ye out for to see, a
prophet?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yea, and a true prophet concerning the
things of God.&nbsp; If you know not now, the day is coming when
&ldquo;ye <i>shall</i> know that there has been a prophet among
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; For myself, I desire this once publicly to
testify that I have never heard a sermon from his lips (and I
have heard many) or spent half-an-hour in his company (and I have
spent many), without gaining conscious benefit to my soul.</p>
<p>Can any of you who heard it, forget that last sermon of his on
Sunday week?&nbsp; Did you mark the look of holy joy in his dear
face, as he portrayed the eager readiness of the Baptist for
martyrdom, a martyrdom which would solve his last doubt, deliver
him from his last sin, free him from his last infirmity, and
place before his opened eyes the face of the King?&nbsp; Yes, on
Wednesday morning <i>his</i> eyes looked upon Jesus, who for long
years <i>had</i> looked on no man.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has received
his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But are you aware that he had proposed to return to the
subject of John the Baptist? that very shortly before his
translation (for it was translation rather than death), that
verse was <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>constantly in his thoughts: &ldquo;John did no miracle,
but all things that John spake of this man were true&rdquo; (John
x. 41).&nbsp; Well, all I can say is of our beloved friend and
pastor, if <i>he</i> did no miracle, <i>God</i> did many miracles
by him.&nbsp; Who shall reckon up the number of precious souls
saved, cheered, taught, strengthened, made meet for the
Master&rsquo;s use by means of him who now rests from his
labours, but whose works <i>do</i>, yea, and <i>shall</i> follow
him.&nbsp; One thing, I believe, eternity will show&mdash;not
that your minister was a perfect minister or a perfect man; he
had his faults, his mistakes, his sins&mdash;but this is what
eternity will show, and oh! the weight of responsibility it lays
on <i>all</i> of us: &ldquo;<i>The things which Francis Storr
spake of Jesus Christ were true</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet once more.&nbsp; With special prayer and consideration, he
drew up for this winter a Course of Wednesday Evening
Lectures.&nbsp; Two only, out of the twelve, were
delivered.&nbsp; The subject of the third was announced, as
usual, in church for the following Wednesday, but the address was
not given.&nbsp; And what <i>was</i> the subject?&nbsp; &ldquo;By
it, he being dead, yet speaketh;&rdquo; &ldquo;and when he had
said this, he fell asleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; What does that word
<i>it</i> refer to&mdash;&ldquo;by it, he being dead, yet
speaketh&rdquo;?&nbsp; Abel&rsquo;s sacrifice, type of
Christ&rsquo;s, which Abel looked at and God accepted.&nbsp; To
the worth of that atoning sacrifice Abel testified, your pastor
testified, in life, unto death, and for ever.&nbsp; The lecture
was not delivered.&nbsp; His death, not his living voice, was to
declare it, for we had the text, and the text <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>only,
&ldquo;and when he had said this, he fell asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you remember, brethren, the last time we all met&mdash;he,
and you, and I, for prayer and praise and conference at the
opening of the year, in that well-loved school-room&mdash;do you
remember that the speaker was led to quote these
lines?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The great and terrible wilderness of famine
and of drought<br />
Lies in the shadow behind me, for the Lord hath brought me
out;<br />
The great and terrible river, though shrouded still from view,<br
/>
Lies in the shadow before me, but the Lord will bring me
through.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now he has reached that river, and crossed it, Christ and
he&mdash;the Master and his beloved disciple.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
two went on;&rdquo; &ldquo;they two went over.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So they passed over quickly towards the
goal,<br />
But the wistful, loving gaze of the parting soul<br />
Grew only more rapt and joyful as he held his Master&rsquo;s
hand;<br />
Methinks or ever he was aware, they were come to the Holy
Land.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so his favourite oft-repeated text, &ldquo;Or ever I was
aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Ammi-nadib&rdquo;
(Song Sol. vi. 12), was fulfilled.&nbsp; Literally, the words
are, &ldquo;Or ever I was aware, my soul set me on the chariots
of my willing people.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah! these were &ldquo;the
chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof,&rdquo; which raised
his spirits and lifted him heavenward, while he was still down
here, <i>his people</i> &ldquo;<i>made willing in the day of
God&rsquo;s power</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beloved, we may raise him
higher yet! we may gladden his heart still! we may cause his
reward to grow exceedingly, we may yet give him souls for his
hire, seals to his ministry!&nbsp; Shall we not hear him to-day,
dead yet speaking, beseeching us <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>on this his first Sabbath in heaven,
to carry on and carry out the work God permitted him to do among
us?&nbsp; &ldquo;If there is therefore any comfort in Christ, if
any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any
tender mercies and compassions, <i>fulfil ye my joy</i>!&rdquo;
(Phil. ii. 1, R. V.).</p>
<p>That we may do it, let us give earnest heed to the prayer of
our master&rsquo;s Christ, for the answer is not doubtful:
&ldquo;While I was with them in the world, I kept them in Thy
name. . . . and now come I to Thee, and these things I speak. . .
. <i>that they might have my joy fulfilled in
themselves</i>,&rdquo; (John xvii. 12, 13).</p>

<p>I <span class="smcap">propose</span> to you for your own

the special passages which allude to him, and pass them not
lightly over, and see and mark the great reformer, still more the
great forerunner.&nbsp; That which may be done at any time is too
often not done at all; thus our Church has wisely set before us
certain seasons for meditation on certain subjects.</p>

buildings!&nbsp; No, we want a heart for these services; we want

<p>1.&nbsp; If you notice particularly Matt, iii., Luke i., John
iii. (towards the end of the chapter), Luke iii., Mark vi., you
will have before you the comprehensive features of John the
Baptist&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Let me direct you to his
credentials.&nbsp; This is the man who was prophesied of seven
centuries before the coming of the Lord, not in Isaiah xl. only,
but in Malachi iv. 5.&nbsp; He went into the wilderness, the less
inhabited country.&nbsp; He probably had tried Jerusalem; it is
not unlikely that he had consorted with the learned Jews.&nbsp;
He found little encouragement, it may be.&nbsp; Then he cast
himself on the Lord&mdash;<span class="smcap">He</span> never
disappoints.&nbsp; We shall ever and anon (God grant always) cast
ourselves on Him&mdash;there is no disappointment there.&nbsp;
The world disappoints, friends disappoint, there is very much
disappointment in our own hearts.&nbsp; God never
disappoints.</p>
<p>Men would consider it a great waste of time, those three years
in the desert&mdash;so much for him to do, so much misery and
wickedness and sin.&nbsp; There <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>he was in the desert, assuredly not
doing nothing for men, but in the wilderness, holding little
intercourse with men.&nbsp; Rely upon it, the greatest things
done for God are done in secret.&nbsp; Religion does not come
forth full-blown.&nbsp; God sows the seed; the roots strike
downward, unseen.&nbsp; Self-examination, self-discipline,
communion with God,&mdash;these fit men for great enterprises,
for conflict in daily life, and for the trustful and rejoicing
walk with God.&nbsp; Self-examination&mdash;very mild and
charitable towards others, very strict and exacting towards
ourselves.&nbsp; Converse with God: there is no one you can tell
everything to, but God.&nbsp; Away with the idea of confession to
our fellow-man&mdash;casting our burden upon the priest, as
though he could take it to God for us.&nbsp; That is not the way
of the saints of God.&nbsp; No, we want much converse with God,
much searching of His Word, and what that Word saith to us
individually, whenever we hear His voice speaking to us, do
it.&nbsp; George M&uuml;ller, at the age of twenty, made this
Book &ldquo;the man of his counsels.&rdquo;&nbsp;
M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s life is one of the most wonderful miracles of
Providence that ever was performed; that man, without ever asking
for one farthing from anyone, committed his way to the Lord,
walked with God, and in fifty years a million of money has passed
through his hands; I forget how many orphans he has clothed and
fed.&nbsp; It is just as much a miracle as when the ravens fed
Elijah, brought him bread and flesh every morning and
evening.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>Now,
the season of Lent reminds us of self-examination, of
self-judgment; and surely if self-judgment, it will be
self-condemnation.&nbsp; It bids us take everything to God: thus
shall we be blessed in the Lord, and in the power of the Holy
Ghost we shall have His peace pervading our hearts.&nbsp; Now let
us proceed to&mdash;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Witness.</p>
<p>It was in &ldquo;the fulness of time&rdquo; that our Lord
came.&nbsp; They had often been asking, Where are the signs of
His coming?&nbsp; It is of no use for man&rsquo;s clock to strike
before God&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If I may say so with reverence,
God&rsquo;s clock struck, and then John the Baptist
came&mdash;six months before the Lord.&nbsp; Long predicted and
anticipated, at length he came.&nbsp; He was of good
parentage.&nbsp; There is a great deal in being of good
parentage.&nbsp; &ldquo;The seed of the blessed of the
Lord&rdquo; (Isa. lxv. 23).&nbsp; The real thing&mdash;that is
what we want; not gilding or veneer, but the good heart of
oak.&nbsp; &ldquo;They were both righteous before God,&rdquo;
etc. (Luke i. 6).&nbsp; That is the good parentage.&nbsp;
Children are apt to follow parents really walking &ldquo;in the
ways of the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His witness was uncompromising.&nbsp; It was no time for
mincing words.&nbsp; &ldquo;The axe is laid unto the root of the
tree,&rdquo; etc. (Matt. iii. 10).&nbsp; He went straight to the
mark.</p>
<p>His witness was general.&nbsp; Observe this, when you hear men
say, &ldquo;The Gospel is not to be preached to all; it is only
for the elect.&rdquo;&nbsp; God has <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>His elect; God forbid that we should
deny it.&nbsp; But how shall we know them?</p>
<p>It was a good answer of John Newton&rsquo;s (too familiar it
may have been) when one was finding fault with him for preaching
the Gospel to all men, he said, &ldquo;You chalk the elect, and
then I will preach to them apart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though the words
are too familiar, they strike the right note.&nbsp; John preached
the Gospel to all, &ldquo;Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is
at hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark you, the same word his blessed Master
preached (Matt. iv. 17).&nbsp; &ldquo;Repent
ye,&rdquo;&mdash;change your mind; go straight to Christ, to
God.&nbsp; Cease to do evil by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Though the Gospel has been preached from this place forty to
fifty years, there are those who sit there, year after year, just
as they were.&nbsp; How will they be found in the Day of the
Lord?</p>
<p>As his witness was wholly uncompromising and general, so was
it <i>practical</i>.&nbsp; He went direct to the mark.&nbsp; The
soldiers, the publicans, the people, all came to him; even the
Pharisees stripped off, or rather covered over, their
phylacteries.&nbsp; The Spirit of the Living God to convince of
sin and quicken the conscience of each sinner&mdash;that is what
we want.&nbsp; Unless we speak in the Holy Ghost and in power, we
might as well, and far better, never speak at all.</p>
<p>The soldiers were coming into very great power at that time;
he told them, &ldquo;Do no violence,&rdquo; etc., &ldquo;and be
content with your wages.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the tax-gatherers (who
were utterly different <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>from ours) had great opportunities of
over-reaching; and some did not fail to take advantage of the
power.&nbsp; Sad advantage for them.&nbsp; He told them,
&ldquo;Exact no more than that which is appointed
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He that hath two garments, let him
impart to him that hath none.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you can do good to
any one, do it; if you have small means, use them; if you have
great, use them.&nbsp; John used very plain language, &ldquo;O
generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath
to come?&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, beloved, John could hardly have moved
in polite society, for he ventured to speak of hell, of
&ldquo;the unquenchable fire,&rdquo; of &ldquo;the wrath to
come.&rdquo;&nbsp; He told them to <i>flee</i>, not to creep, not
to walk, &ldquo;from the wrath to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
urged&mdash;his Master rather urged&mdash;&ldquo;Repent
ye,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; He spoke to the conscience.&nbsp; Oh, that
the Lord in my few remaining days, if any more days are given me,
oh, that He would make my words more plain.&nbsp; I have striven
to be plain, brethren.</p>
<p>John was the uncompromising, the faithful, the affectionate
witness.&nbsp; We want a practical religion.&nbsp; If not
practical, we had better throw it behind our backs; it will not
profit us in the last day.&nbsp; What is the use of our religion
if it is not to influence our life, if it is not to make you,
dear children, better children, more obedient children, keeping
your tongues from evil words, making you kind and gentle, your
father&rsquo;s joy and your mother&rsquo;s darling, because they
can trust you?&nbsp; As a dear little grandchild of mine said,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what papa <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>would do without me; I&rsquo;m his
right hand, he says,&rdquo; and she added, &ldquo;Oh, I
don&rsquo;t know what I should do without him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes,
we want practical religion.&nbsp; If we are not honest-hearted,
faithful to our trust, if we do not to others as we would they
should do to us, when we get to the gate of heaven and begin
<i>then</i> to look for our religion, to hunt for our
certificate, it will not be found.&nbsp; The man without the
wedding garment was speechless.</p>
<p>I remember an account of a ship that struck on rocks; they
rose sheer and precipitous&mdash;not a chance of escape.&nbsp;
All at once a ladder was let down from the top of the rock, and
the poor sailors, who had given up hope, escaped all safe to
land.</p>
<p>You are on the edge of the sea of eternity.&nbsp; The tide is
coming in, the waves rolling up one after another; but there is a
Rock.&nbsp; You must reach it, you must cling to it.&nbsp; How
are you going to do it?&nbsp; You are not flies, children, that
you can walk up a perpendicular wall.&nbsp; We have got something
far more difficult to do&mdash;to live to God, to glorify God in
our daily walk and conversation.&nbsp; In other words, you want
&ldquo;a ladder set up&rdquo; (Gen. xxviii. 12).</p>
<p>What is that Ladder?&nbsp; John the Baptist preached holiness,
practice.&nbsp; He was a practical man, because he did not teach
men to make bricks without straw&mdash;he pointed them to
Christ.&nbsp; Standing by the river Jordan, and seeing Jesus
coming, he directed <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>all the people to Him with the words, &ldquo;Behold the
Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That was his ladder.&nbsp; There is no godliness without Christ:
&ldquo;Without Me ye can do nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The man who
seeks safety on any other raft&mdash;lifeboat he may call
it&mdash;is venturing on the ocean of Eternity in an unseaworthy
craft.&nbsp; We must rest simply and wholly on Him, the Lamb of
God, the Alpha and Omega&mdash;trust and know and love, as well
as serve, the Lord Jesus.&nbsp; Now, time fails me, brethren, and
I want very much to speak to you about the closing scene.&nbsp; I
must do so as briefly as I can.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The closing scene of his life.</p>
<p>A great deal is made of the closing scene of a man&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; Take, for instance, one who has lived to himself all
through life; he is on his death-bed, we strain our ears to hear
if we can, any word to give a glimmer of hope.&nbsp; He may have
lived as he listed, and then at the close of life, when he is at
the last gasp, and Death has him in his grip, friends lean over
the pillow and question, &ldquo;Are you trusting in
Christ?&rdquo; and if the whispered answer should be
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they are satisfied!&nbsp; Poor dying man! what
else is left for him to do?&nbsp; Is such an act, at such a
moment, real faith?&nbsp; If a house is on fire, and a man leaps
from the second storey window, you do not say he is a good
leaper.&nbsp; What else could he do?&nbsp; I do not mean to say
that there may not be such a thing as a death-bed repentance, but
a death-bed repentance <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>can scarcely be called
satisfactory.&nbsp; Tell me what a man&rsquo;s <i>life</i> has
been&mdash;has it been spent in Christ&rsquo;s service and to the
glory of God?&mdash;and I care not <i>that</i> whether he has any
last words on his death-bed or not.</p>
<p>Look at John the Baptist&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; You do not find
the account of many deathbeds in Scripture&mdash;the fact is, the
great thing is how a man lives.&nbsp; Is Christ his life?&nbsp;
Is holiness the result?&nbsp; Then will he lift up his head in
joy whether in life or death.</p>
<p>Look at that last scene in the life of John the Baptist.&nbsp;
He had had a great and strong struggle.&nbsp; Read his life, my
children.&nbsp; You like story-books; you will find this Book far
more entertaining than you think for, as, for example, the story
of the three children in the fire, Daniel in the lion&rsquo;s
den, and the story of the earthquake and shipwreck as told in the
life of St. Paul.&nbsp; John was in prison, imprisoned by the
king&mdash;(I pass over his uncompromising witness against
sin).&nbsp; It is difficult to speak before the great; it is
comparatively an easy thing for me to stand up here and say, My
fellow sinner, thou art going to hell!&nbsp; &ldquo;Come with us
and we will do thee good.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>A cloud had come over John the Baptist&rsquo;s mind; the faith
which had hitherto borne him up, is now sharply exercised.&nbsp;
He sent his disciples to Jesus.&nbsp; I do not think that he had
the disciples&rsquo; good <i>only</i> in view.&nbsp; Our blessed
Lord &ldquo;in that same hour cured many,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; (Luke
vii. 21, 22), <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>and answered them, &ldquo;Go your way,&rdquo; etc. (ver.
22); and He added this (Oh, I thank God for that addition),
&ldquo;And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Have you ever had prayers so answered&mdash;I
hope you have had many&mdash;that you almost, as they say, leapt
out of your skin, you have been so astounded?&nbsp; You will have
many more if you &ldquo;come boldly to the Throne of
Grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe then, when the Lord sent this
message to His faithful servant, He answered the very want and
questioning of his heart, and that word satisfied the yearning of
his heart.&nbsp; John the Baptist must have said, &ldquo;Why, He
knows my very thoughts, my very doubts, my failings, my
fears!&rdquo;&nbsp; May I not thus interpret?&nbsp; I do not add
to the Word of God.</p>
<p>All clouds disappeared; the Sun of Righteousness shines out
with healing in His wings.&nbsp; By-and-by there is the glimmer
of a light, the sound of the key in the lock.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! my
lord&rdquo; (so the jailor would probably have called the
prophet), &ldquo;I bring you heavy tidings&mdash;the king has
sent his executioner.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Heavy tidings?&nbsp;
Nay, joyous tidings! blessed tidings! glorious tidings!&nbsp;
Lord Jesus, I thank Thee!&nbsp; Where is he?&nbsp; Do not keep me
one moment from heaven and glory!&rdquo;&nbsp; Down he laid his
head on the block joyfully, and another saint was in glory!&nbsp;
Oh, my brethren, think what that will be&mdash;&ldquo;For ever
with the Lord&rdquo;!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
